## What it is
Luumy is a web application that allows users to create an account and store their favorite albums or any albums they've listened to in one list. Albums are displayed within their own respective cards inside of a grid layout. 
Users have the option to choose their favorite track of the album from a dropdown, score the album from 1-10, and provide their notes about the album. A user's album list can be filtered by name or artist. A list
can also be sorted by score, title, or artist. A user can edit an album card or remove an album from their list.
Users can add an album by looking it up within that application and the Spotify WebAPI will find albums closely related to a user's query. 

## Technologies Used
This web application was built using the MERN stack. 
React was used as the frontend framework, built alongside TailwindCSS for styling and using third-party components from Material UI.
MongoDB was used as the database and Mongoose was used to connect MongoDB and Node.js. 
Json Web Tokens were used for user authentication.
The Spotify WebAPI was used to retrieve album metadata from the spotify database.
